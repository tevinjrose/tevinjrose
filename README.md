## Hey, I'm Tevin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend/software engineer focused on building systems that have real-world impact. Iâ€™ve worked with Java (Spring Boot), Python, and SQL, to name a few and Iâ€™m getting deeper into C++ and systems-level programming to expand into areas like aerospace, logistics, and high-performance tech.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m especially drawn to:
- Projects where software meets the physical world
- Roles where I can stretch both backend skills and low-level thinking

ðŸ§  Outside of code, I enjoy readingâ€”usually biographies, stories of innovation, or deep dives into how people and ideas shape the world. I log some of those reads at [tevinjrose.com](https://tevinjrose.com).
